# CustomerSegmentationUsingKMeansClustering

Every ecommerce website has a main goal that is to how to make their customers buy more products. 
Segmentation plays an important role to learn their customers behavior, so here I have worked on market analytics dataset. 
Dataset contains data about customers from different classes. 
This dataset also contains data of different advertisement campaigns and there was a need to identify which customer is going to choose which advertisement campaigns. 
Another main goal of analysis is to improve the business by finding out the perfect customer segment and targeting them. 

Tools which will be used in this problem are:
Pandas will be used to import and perform data manipulations. Seaborn and matplotlib will be used to analyze and visualize the features to comprehend the relations. PCA was implemented for dimensionality reduction to transform large set of variables into smaller ones that contains most of the information in the larger set. Clustering was performed to solve this problem.
